**Algorithm for the code**:

Algorithm: Count Chord Intersections

Input:

1 - List of radians 

2 - List of identifiers 

Output:
Total number of intersections among the chords


Steps:

1) Create Events: Iterate through radian_measures and identifiers, generating events for each chord.

2) Use 1 for the start of a chord and -1 for the end.

3) Sort Events: Sort the events based on radian measure.

4) Initialize count to 0 and active_chords as an empty set. Sweep through events, updating count based on the number of active chords intersecting with the sweep line.

5) Count Intersections: Return the final count of intersections.


**Estimation of Big O runtime**: 
> The big O runtime of the provided code has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of chords.
