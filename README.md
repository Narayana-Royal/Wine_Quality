**Algorithm for the code**:

Algorithm: Count Chord Intersections

Input:

1 - List of radians radians

2 - List of identifiers identifiers

Output:
Total number of intersections among the chords


Steps:

1) Create an empty binary search tree root.
2) Initialize a variable intersections to store the total number of intersections, set it to 0.
3) Combine radians and identifiers into pairs and sort them based on radians.
4) Iterate over each pair of sorted radians and identifiers:

a. For each pair (radian, identifier):

i. Count the number of intersections at the current radian using the count_intersections function with arguments root, radian, and identifier.

ii. Add the result to the intersections variable.

iii. Insert the current chord into the binary search tree root using the insert function with arguments root, radian, and identifier.

5) After processing all chords, return the final value of intersections as the result.



**Estimation of Big O runtime**: 
> The big O runtime of this code is O(nlogn) on average.

> In the worst case, when the binary search tree formed by the chords becomes highly unbalanced, the time complexity could degrade to O(n^2).
