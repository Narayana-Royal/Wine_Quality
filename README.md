**Algorithm for the code**:

Algorithm: Count Chord Intersections

Input:

1 - List of radians 

2 - List of identifiers 

Output:
Total number of intersections among the chords


Steps:

1) Create Events: Iterate through radian_measures and identifiers, generating events for each chord.

2) Use 1 for the start of a chord and -1 for the end.

3) Sort Events: Sort the events based on radian measure.

4) Initialize count to 0 and active_chords as an empty set. Sweep through events, updating count based on the number of active chords intersecting with the sweep line.

5) Count Intersections: Return the final count of intersections.

**How to run code**:

1) Provide 2 inputs radian_measures (as list) and identifiers (as list)
> Sample Input : radian_measures = [0.78, 1.47, 1.77, 3.92] , identifiers = ["s_1", "s_2", "e_1", "e_2"]

2) Call the function: count_intersections(radian_measures,identifiers) with 2 input parameters and this function will return the number (i.e number of intersections)
> Sample Output : 1 (for the above input case)

**Estimation of Big O runtime**: 
> The big O runtime of the provided code has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of chords.
