# Algorithm for the code:
> Algorithm: Count Chord Intersections
> Input:

> List of radians radians
> List of identifiers identifiers
Output:

Total number of intersections among the chords
Steps:

Initialize a variable root to store the root of the binary search tree (initially set to None).
Initialize a variable intersections to store the total number of intersections (initially set to 0).
Iterate over each pair of radians and identifiers obtained by sorting radians and identifiers together.
For each pair (radian, identifier):
Call the count_intersections function with arguments root, radian, and identifier to count the number of intersections at the current radian.
Add the result to the intersections variable.
Update root by calling the insert function with arguments root, radian, and identifier to insert the current chord into the binary search tree.
After processing all chords, return the final value of intersections as the result.
Algorithm for count_intersections function:

Input:

Current root node of the binary search tree root
Radian value of the current chord radian
Identifier of the current chord identifier
Output:

Number of chords intersecting with the current chord
Steps:

If root is None, return 0 (no intersections).
If radian is less than the radian of the current root node:
Return the sum of root.count (number of chords in the right subtree) and the result of calling count_intersections recursively with arguments root.left, radian, and identifier (to count intersections in the left subtree).
Otherwise (if radian is greater than or equal to the radian of the current root node):
Return the result of calling count_intersections recursively with arguments root.right, radian, and identifier (to count intersections in the right subtree).

**Estimation of Big O runtime**: 
> The big O runtime of this code is O(nlogn) on average.
> In the worst case, when the binary search tree formed by the chords becomes highly unbalanced, the time complexity could degrade to O(n^2).
